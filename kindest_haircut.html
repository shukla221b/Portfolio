    <h1>The Kindest Haircut</h1>

  <div class="story-container">
    <p class="paragraph">As I walked past the door of the American Hair Salon, I caught a glimpse of two ladies dressed in black. The sunlight reflecting off the glass made it difficult to see inside. For a moment, I considered walking past—surely, a place like this would be expensive. But my hair had grown quite long, and I needed to get it cut.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">I hesitated, then turned back and tried to open the door. It didn’t budge.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">One of the ladies in black came and unlocked it. A gentle scent of lavender clung to her... like warm towels in fancy places. She was elderly, with Asian features and short, neatly styled hair. Her smile greeted me warmly, as though I were an old friend returning after years.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Inside, the salon wasn’t anything fancy. A board on the wall listed the prices. A humble jacket stand stood nearby. A water filter hummed in the corner, soft jazz floated overhead, and a potted plant added a touch of life.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">“How are you doing today?” she asked kindly. For a moment, I wanted to tell her everything... but I simply replied, “Good, thanks.”</p>

    <p class="paragraph">From the looks of it, the salon was just opening. The floor was spotless, combs neatly arranged. The other lady, drying her own hair, must’ve had early cleaning duty.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">I hung up my jacket and sat down. The chair was a little too high; my feet barely touched the ground. She said, “You are my first customer today. Would you like water?” I declined, then regretted it immediately.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">She studied my hair like an artist would a blank canvas. “Very long,” she said. I shrugged, “I’ve been busy.”</p>

    <p class="paragraph">She smiled and began cutting—scissors from a sanitizer machine, movements as gentle as feathers. It reminded me of my grandmother running her fingers through my hair.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Scissor snips mingled with the soft jazz. A haircut always brings memories. I thought of Junaid Bhai back home, juggling customers while gossiping. Funny, what haircuts unlock.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">“Do you miss home?” she asked, reading my thoughts. “A little,” I replied. “It’s different here.”</p>

    <p class="paragraph">She nodded, “Even a place far from home can be kind to you, if you let it.”</p>

    <p class="paragraph">The other lady kept herself busy, wiping counters and adjusting tools—quiet grace in motion.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">When stray hair landed on my nose, she brushed it off without a word. I muttered thanks. She chuckled.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">“See how much hair you had? And now it’s all gone,” she said. I laughed at the simplicity—but it stayed with me.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">At the counter, she placed a wrapped candy beside the receipt. “A little sweet for the day,” she said, with a smile like a promise.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Outside, the wind brushed my freshly cut hair. I caught my reflection—lighter, neater, as if I’d shed an old self. I turned the corner, candy in mouth, and the salon’s soft jazz faded into the hum of the city.</p>
